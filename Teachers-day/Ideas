# Ideas for Teachers Day:
- Write a song that combines all the jokes made in class, e.g. Ms Chia's puns :)
  - For example:
    1. Be like a proton and stay positive :smile:
    2. Nitrogen is the most enthusiastic :grin:
    3. Light is too light to be matter
    4. Eye cannot see: **chef's kiss**
